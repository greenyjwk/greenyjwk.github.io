<br>I dream of helping people who need medical help by applying machine learning. I am currently researching histopathology image analysis with self-supervised learning to increase the performance of tumor classification. This blog is the place where I want to share what I have learned with others for more interactive learning. I am pleased to interact and also discuss my postings. Please feel free to reach out anytime :)
