## EEG Feature Extraaction and Data Augmentation in Emotion Reognition

- Problem Statement
  - Lacl of EEG datasets and high dimensional EEG recordings lead difficulty in building accurate emotional analysis models.

### Contribution

- Using SVM and deep generative models were used to build emotional analysis model.
- Using COnditional Wasserstein GAN to create features in eeg datsets.
