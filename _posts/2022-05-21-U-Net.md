### <br>Image Segmentation

#### Input images

- Class label is assigned to to each pixel
- Input images are split to multiple patches so that it could have much larger number of input images than original datasets.
- Input of the U-Net has larger size than outputs. Because the input images has padding.

- The reason why the output class is two is because the datasets have two different classes.



#### Contracting Path

- Learning what is in the image?



#### Expanding Path

- Learning where the objects are?



### Training

- Cross Entropy Loss maske stee output have two channels.

- Some people say that output could have one channel and will have sigmoid function to classify.



### Prediction

- Overlap-tile is used when prediction.
