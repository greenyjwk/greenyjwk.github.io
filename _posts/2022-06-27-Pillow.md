### converting 3channels from Numpy ndarray

I ran into the error at work converting pillow instance to numpy array.

```python
# Converting Pillow instance with three channels
#PIL_image = PIL_image.convert("RGB") -> It makes error. imgArray = np.asarray(PIL_image.convert("RGB")) doesn't make error.

# Casting to Pillow to Numpy
imgArray = np.asarray(PIL_image.convert("RGB"))
```
