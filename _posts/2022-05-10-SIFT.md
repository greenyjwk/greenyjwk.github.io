SIFT is the image feature exraction algorithm. It detects the features from the image that is invariant from the scale and rotation.

### Scale-Space extrema detection

When a person looks images, he looks the big chunk of the image or looks the detailed part of the image. In other words, entire picture and detailed part are both neccessary for a person sees the image. From the SIFT, it has high features and low feature of the image by implementing four octave images with five degree of blurring for each scale. The Scale space is the group of the image with variant scales.
