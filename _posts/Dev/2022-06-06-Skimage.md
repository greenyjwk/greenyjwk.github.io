### <br>resize

Resize serves and allows to specify an output image shape instead of a scaling factor. It should perform Gaussian smoothing to avoid aliasing artifacts.

Aliasing: an error or distortion created in a digital image that usually appears as a jagged outline.

```python
img = resize(img, (IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH), mode='constant', preserve_range=True)
```



io.imread returns numpy ndarray

```python
from skimage import io, transform, color

path = drive_path + "/dummy_imageout.tif"
img = io.imread(path)[0:1]
print(type(img))
```
