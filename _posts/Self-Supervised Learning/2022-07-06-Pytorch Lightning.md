### SSLOnlineEvaluator

<br>Appends a MLP for fine-tuning to the given model. Callback has its own mini-inner loop. 



### <br>Multilayer Perceptron

A multilayer perceptron is a neural network connecting multiple layers in a directed graph, which means that the signal path through the nodes only goes one way. Each node, apart from the input nodes, has a nonlinear activation function. An MLP uses backpropagation as a supervised learning technique. Since there are multiple layers of neurons, MLP is a deep learning technique.

MLP is widely used for solving problems that require supervised learning as well as research into computational neuroscience and parallel distributed processing. Applications include speech recognition, image recognition and machine translation.

### <br>callback

The callback function in deep learning is the function that is performed during training is processed. The optimal parameters are stored or the training is terminated when the validation performance is not increased any more.
